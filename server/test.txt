Running the server:
==============
Use the following script to start the server

    ./server.sh

To stop the server, type "quit" on the screen.

Using the above command, the server starts with a set of default parameters. 
You can modify the script server.sh to specify your own parameters.

    java -jar ffserver.jar port delay loss

where,

port: the server TCP port number.

delay: the average ACK delay.

The server uses this parameter to wait for some random delay before 
sending each ACK. The actual delay is generated randomly so that the 
average delay is equal to this parameter.


loss: the segment loss probability.

It specifies the ratio of lost segments at the server. The server randomly 
drops arriving segments. The probability that the server drops a segment 
is given by this parameter.
 

Changing the Log Level
=================

Modify the file logging.properties to change the log level for the server. Specifically, 
you can change the log level by modifying the following line in the config file:

cpsc441.a3.server.level = INFO
 

For example, changing INFO to FINE will produce a lot more logging messages.


No Software is Bug-Free!
========================
If you discover a critical bug in the server, let me know to fix it. 
You should however treat the server nicely or it may crash!
